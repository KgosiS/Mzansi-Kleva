### **Smart Learning. Proudly Mzansi. Built for the Youth, by the Youth.**

Mzansi Kleva is an educational + quiz mobile app designed specifically for South African learners, students, and youth.

Growing up in SA, most learning apps never felt like they were made for us â€” the slang, the culture, our school system, our everyday realitiesâ€¦ it wasnâ€™t there.

So I decided to build one myself.

Mzansi Kleva makes learning **local, fun, interactive, and empowering** â€” using relatable content, AI-powered explanations (Gemini), and gamified quizzes.

##  Why I Built This

As a young South African developer and student, I wanted to build something real â€” not just a portfolio project, but a solution that can **open doors for the youth**, especially:

* Township learners
* Rural students
* First-gen university kids
* Anyone trying to level up

We don't just need tech **for Africa** â€” we need tech **from Africa**.
